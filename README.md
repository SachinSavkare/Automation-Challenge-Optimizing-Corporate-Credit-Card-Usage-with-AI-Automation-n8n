## 📌 Overview
BizPro Solutions is struggling with scattered employee credit card usage. With different cards offering unique rewards, annual fees, and late fee penalties, optimizing this system manually is inefficient.

This project presents an **AI-powered automation pipeline** built using **n8n + Google Gemini + Google Docs API** to:

- Extract key financial fields from PDF credit card statements
- Generate credit card usage recommendations using AI
- Merge insights into a structured Google Doc report
- Help CFOs make smarter, reward-maximizing decisions

This README explains the full architecture, setup, prompts, inputs/outputs, and strategic intent.
